As is tradition when working through a programming tutorial, here is my "hello world" post. It's been ages since I've blogged and I thought messing with [Jekyll][jekylldocs] would be a convenient way to not only stretch my writing muscles again, but to track stuff I'm working on and exploring.

I'm deploying this to Github pages using [their documentation on the subject][tutorial].

Hello world!
